In these two small projects we have tried to show how efficient CNNs can be in classification even for images with artificially reduces quality and additional
transformations like rotation and brightness.
Also we have used confusion matrix \cite{scikit-learn} to see when and possibly why our model confuses particular images and cases.
In general, even a model with 8 and 16 feature maps performed well with more than 94\% accuracy while the best complex model
achieved almost 96\% performance for the sign language work, and over 98\% for the gender classification work.
