In this section I'll describe the model and the modifications I've made during second phase.
\subsection{The Model}
I chose a CNN, no other choice for that kind of task.
I started from a known network that I previously used for a similar task, comvbined with an intuition from a known model
for image classification.
I played a little with the number of filters for each layer, this way I can capture more features.
The problem with this method was that it take a lot of RAM (over 4GB), which made me debug on a pre-trained resnet18.
