In this section I'll describe the model and the modifications I've made during second phase.
\subsection{The Model}
I chose a CNN, no other choice for that kind of task.
I started from a known network that I previously used for a similar task, combined with an intuition from a known model
for image classification.
I played a little with the number of filters for each layer, this way I can capture more features.
The problem with this method was that it take a lot of RAM (over 4GB), which made me debug on a pre-trained resnet18.

\subsection{Training}
The training phase includes three models:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{NI} Natural Image:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A Pre-Trained Model that detects human beings (alongside other)
        \item Isn't being used for final classification
        \item Used for Human Model Retraining
    \end{itemize}
    \item Human Model
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Fine tune \ref{NI} model's top layer
        \item Classes: elaborated in \ref{firstModel}
        \item Add three classes (with\_mask, without\_mask, mask\_weared\_incorrect
        \item Remove 'person' class in return
        \item Used to determine if the object is a person
    \end{itemize}
    \item Face Mask Detection
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A model we train from scratch
        \item Classes: elaborated in \ref{secondModel}
        \item Used for Human Model Retraining
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Testing Pipeline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Take an image
    \item Determine if the object/s in the picture are human (using Human Detection Model model)
    \item Crop the object/s one by one (using first model), \& determine masked/non-masked/partially-masked (using second model)
\end{itemize}
